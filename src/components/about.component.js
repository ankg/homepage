				Dust and Deceit and pigs aplenty
				I was born and brought up in Kanpur
				till I turned twenty

				My family was into business of clothes and tyres,
				they imbibed in me a hustle and some burning desires.

				I got the chance to learn software in the hills,
				engage in a meaning, engage in some thrills.
				IIT Roorkee was a gem, in the obscurity it hid
				turned me from a shy boy to a super confident kid.

				I graduated and suddenly the world was too big,
				the world a flywheel, and me just a pig.
				After 26 interviews, I was taken by Goldman Sachs
				Learnt a lot of finance and a bit about tax.

				I still felt hungry, the world was calling me,
				Coz Elon Musk needs some competition, doesn't he?

				So here I am, a young startup guy,
				who is now big on blockchain and DeFi.

				The dream is on.
