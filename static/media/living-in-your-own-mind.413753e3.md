How much time of your day and your lives have you spent living in someone else’s mind?

You probably know your own answer, but my answer is A LOT.

### Context - It’s not all your fault

50 years back when your world was limited to some 40 real people that you regularly met and 100 virtual people that you read about in the newspaper, your circle of influence was so well within your control. You could live your life in your own mind, without being affected by external stimuli.

Fast forward 50 years, thanks to Instagram, Youtube, and especially Linkedin, there is an ocean of external stimulation and you live anywhere but in your own mind. I hang out with Dhruv Rathee in the morning, Crypto Influencers in the evening, Logan Paul at night, and Kunal Shah/Naval riiiiiight before I sleep. 

All this exposure to information throughout the day, drugging me to the point of overwhelm, makes me feel pathetic about my own life. All these wonderful people out there are achieving something daily, but not you.

### How it is harmful to you

The effect? You leave the long-term goals that you’re laying the foundations for and get distracted into short-term activities that make no sense. You try doing 10 things that you’re not good at instead of sharpening the 2 that you excel in. Heck, you don't even enjoy your work or your day, because Mr. X, who is younger - has a bigger house and an influencer girlfriend.

This is exactly what “long-term unproductive” is. And you do not want that if you EVER want to get anywhere.

### The Solution

Some people are comfortable with this but they are the exception. For most people like me and you, the best course is the simple (but hard) choice to live in our own mind - whatever happens outside.

A shortlist of tricks I use to “live in my own mind”

1. Cutting off social media - It is poison, Linkedin being the most poisonous. Be very watchful of your mental state as you browse these platforms. If they leave you sucked and tired, chances are reducing usage will help.

2. Being watchful of your own mind -  Split your brain into 2 (not literally lol). One part does the thinking, the other part observes the first in action. Streamline thoughts. If it doesn’t come naturally, try meditation 10 mins a day whenever you feel burdened. Oh boy, it is magic.

3. Deep work - Set aside just 1 hour a day doing what you want to do with 100% focus. Could be painting, running, reading, or coding. When 1 hour gets easy, make it 2. Watch this short Ted talk on deep work: Cal Newport TEDx

4. Recognize your individuality - You are a unique, precious, fing amazing being. No, I’m not just saying it without substance - you truly are. I look back at my life and oh god I’ve done so much! I’m sure a lot of people who know me will agree. Likewise, find your own story.

There are 2 ways to live - living in your own mind or living in the minds of 10,000 others. I choose the former since it is the only way I can get anything done. Additionally, the other 9,999 don’t give a f about me anyway, or worse, don't even know I exist.

If you relate to the post and want to discuss your specific thoughts in detail, my doors and ears are always open.
